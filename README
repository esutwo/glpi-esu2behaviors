# ESU2 Behaviors

This is a hard fork of the [Behaviors](https://github.com/yllen/behaviors) plugin with heavily reduced functionality in order to add support for [issue #73](https://github.com/yllen/behaviors/issues/73). This plugin can work side by side the Behaviors plugin.

## Why fork?

I am not happy with the implementation, and not sure if my pull request will be accepted. It functions differently than the original plugin when it assigns the technician and how it performs the checks compared to the original. My biggest complaint is I was unable to figure out an easy way to check if the user in the email had permission to be assigned to tickets. All the code references I found make use of a "session" to check rights, however, there is no session when doing stuff in the background based on a user id. So, until this functionality exists in the original, we have this.

## Special Thanks

* Thanks to the existing [Behaviors plugin](https://github.com/yllen/behaviors) for giving me something to work with.
